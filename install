Basic Installation
==================

The tmp-directory was changed to /var/tmp/havp/ !!!!!

run ./configure --help and choose the right settings

You can configure "havp/default.h" to fit your needs.
This is needed if you want to use a parent proxy or for using HAVP in transparent proxy mode.
Please check the documentation in default.h.

run make and make install

mount a filesystem with mandatory locks to /var/tmp/havp
i.e. mount /dev/hda9 /var/tmp/havp -o mand

Check the permissions:
i.e. chown nobody /var/tmp/havp

run havp!
