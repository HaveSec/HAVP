Basic Installation
==================

This software is GPL!


NEW Changes:
Path to HTML templates and configuration files have changed !!!
White- and Blacklist (this list is very slow. Don't add to many URLs!)

Installation:

configure
make
make install

You can define the virus scanner by the configure --with-scanner= option:
 - libclamav = Clamav Library
 - fprot = F-Prot server (f-protd)
 - aveclient = Kaspersky aveclient

Edit the configfile:
vi /usr/local/etc/havp/havp.config

Edit rights of the logfile directory:

i.e.: mkdir /var/log/havp
Make the directory writable for to the user define in havp.config
i.e. chown nobody /var/log/havp

Create the tempfile directory:
i.e.: mkdir /var/tmp/havp

!!!!!!!!This directory needs mandatory looks!!!!!!!!
Mount a filesystem with mandatory locks to /var/tmp/havp
i.e. mount /dev/hda9 /var/tmp/havp -o mand

You can also use a ramdisk, but downloaded files must be smaller than the ramdisk!
mkfs.ext3 /dev/ram0
mount /dev/ram0 /var/tmp/havp -o mand

Make the directory writable for to the user define in havp.config
i.e. chown nobody /var/tmp/havp

Start havp:

/etc/init.d/havp start

If you have problems check the logfiles

/var/log/havp/havp.log
/var/log/havp/access.log

If you don't want to use the rc-script you can start havp directly:
/usr/local/bin/havp -c Configfile -p Pidfile
/usr/local/bin/havp -h (shows help)
