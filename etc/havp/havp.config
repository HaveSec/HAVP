#
# This is the configuration file for HAVP
# 
# All lines starting with a hash (#) or empty lines are ignored.
# All parameters configurable in this file are explained
# and their default values are shown. (If no default value is 
# defined "None" is specified!)
#
# Change things to fit to your environment!
# 
# General syntax: Parameter Value
# Value can be: true/false, number, or path
# Extra spaces and tabs are ignored.
#

# You must remove this option for HAVP to start.
# This makes sure you have (hopefully) reviewed the configuration. :)
REMOVETHISLINE true

#
# For reasons of security it is recommended to run a proxy program
# without root rights. It is recommended to create user that is not
# used by any other program.
#
# Default:
# USER havp
# GROUP havp

#
# If this is true HAVP is running as daemon in background.
# For testing you may run HAVP at your text console.
#
# Default:
# DAEMON true

#
# Display initial messages on console when starting HAVP.
#
# Default:
# DISPLAYINITIALMESSAGES true

#
# Process id (PID) of the main HAVP process is written to this file.
# Be sure that it is writeable by the user under which HAVP is running.
# /etc/init.d/havp script requires this to work.
#
# Default:
# PIDFILE /var/run/havp/havp.pid

#
# For performance reasons several instances of HAVP have to run.
# Specify how many servers (child processes) are simultaneously
# listening on port PORT for a connection. Minimum value should be
# the peak requests-per-second expected + 5 for headroom.
#
# For single user home use, 8 should be minimum.
# For 500 users corporate use, start at 40.
#
# Value can and should be higher than recommended. Memory and
# CPU usage is only affected by the number of concurrent requests.
#
# Default:
# SERVERNUMBER 8

#
# For big traffic spikes, servers (child processes) will be
# automatically created more if needed. This is the hard limit
# for concurrent requests processed.
#
# Default:
# MAXSERVERS 100

#
# File where we log requests.
# Needs to have write permission for HAVP user.
#
# Default:
# ACCESSLOG /var/log/havp/access.log

#
# true: Log every request to access log
# false: Log only viruses to access log
#
# Default:
# LOG_OKS true

#
# File where we log HAVP messages and errors.
# Needs to have write permission for HAVP user.
#
# Default:
# ERRORLOG /var/log/havp/havp.log

#
# Level of HAVP logging
#  0 = Only serious errors and information
#  1 = Less interesting information is included
#
# Default:
# LOGLEVEL 1

#
# Temporary scan file.
# This file must reside on a partition for which hard locks
# are enabled (so called mandatory locking). For Linux, use
# "-o mand" in the mount command. See mount(1) for details.
# Solaris does not need any special steps, it works directly.
#
# Specify absolute path to a file which name must
# contain "XXXXXX". These six characters are overwritten
# by system call to create unique named tempfiles.
#
# Default:
# SCANTEMPFILE /var/tmp/havp/havp-XXXXXX

#
# Directory for ClamAV and other scanner created tempfiles.
# Needs to be writable by HAVP user.
#
# Default:
# TEMPDIR /var/tmp

#
# HAVP reloads scanners virus database by receiving a signal
# (send SIGHUP to PID from PIDFILE, see kill(1)) or after
# a specified period of time. Specify here the number of
# minutes to wait for reloading.
#
# Default:
# DBRELOAD 60 

#
# Run HAVP as transparent Proxy?
#
# If you don't know what this means read the mini-howto
# TransparentProxy written by Daniel Kiracofe.
# (e.g.: http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/TransparentProxy.html)
# Definitely you have more to do than setting this to true.
# You are warned!
#
# Default:
# TRANSPARENT false

#
# Specify a parent proxy (e.g. Squid) HAVP should use.
#
# Default: None
# PARENTPROXY localhost
# PARENTPORT 3128

#
# Write X-Forwarded-For: to log instead of connecters IP?
#
# If HAVP is used as parent proxy by some other proxy, this allows
# to write the real users IP to log, instead of proxy IP.
#
# Default:
# FORWARDED_IP false

#
# Port HAVP is listening on.
#
# Default:
# PORT 8080

#
# Address to bind to for listening.
#
# NULL for any, 127.0.0.1 for localhost only, or specific address.
#
# Default:
# BIND_ADDRESS NULL

#
# Source IP address to be used for sending outbound packets.
# Let it be undefined if you want OS to handle right address.
#
# Default: None
# SOURCE_ADDRESS 127.0.0.1

#
# Path to template files.
#
# Default:
# TEMPLATEPATH /usr/local/etc/havp/templates/en

#
# Set to true if you want to prefer Whitelist.
# If URL is Whitelisted, then Blacklist is ignored.
# Otherwise Blacklist is preferred.
#
# Default:
# WHITELISTFIRST true

#
# Whitelist of URLs not to scan.
#
# Default:
# WHITELIST /usr/local/etc/havp/whitelist

#
# Blacklist of URLs that are denied access.
#
# Default:
# BLACKLIST /usr/local/etc/havp/blacklist

#
# Is scanner error fatal?
#
# For example, archive types that are not supported by scanner
# may return error. Also is scanner has invalid pattern files etc.
#
# true: User gets error page
# false: No error is reported (viruses might not be detected)
#
# Default:
# FAILSCANERROR true

#
# Allow HTTP Range Requests
#
# false: Broken downloads can NOT resumed
# true: Broken downloads can be resumed
#
# True is a security risk, because partial HTTP requests may
# not be properly scanned.
#
# Default:
# RANGE false

#
# Max size of temporary files on disk.
# 0 = No size limit
#
# Temporary file will grow only up to this size. This means scanner
# will scan data until this limit is reached.
#
# NOTE: Setting limit is a security risk, because some archives like
# ZIP need all the data to be scanned properly! Use this only if you
# can't afford temporary space for big files. Also scanner settings
# will affect how many files will be scanned inside an archive etc.
#
# VALUE IN BYTES NOT KB OR MB!!!!
#
# Default:
# MAXSCANSIZE 0

#
# Amount of data going to browser that is held back, until it
# is scanned. When we know file is clean, this held back data
# can be sent to browser. You can safely set bigger value, only
# thing you will notice is some "delay" in beginning of download.
# Virus found in files bigger than this might not produce HAVP
# error page, but result in a "broken" download.
#
# VALUE IN BYTES NOT KB OR MB!!!!
#
# Default:
# KEEPBACKBUFFER 200000

#
# This setting complements KEEPBACKBUFFER. It tells how many Seconds to
# initially receive data from server, before sending anything to client.
# Even trickling is not done before this time elapses. This way files that
# are received fast are more secure and user can get virus report page for
# files bigger than KEEPBACKBUFFER.
#
# Should not be set very high, if memory is an issue. All data received
# during this time is kept in memory (10 seconds at 1MB/s would reserve
# 10MB+ memory during request).
#
# Setting to 0 will disable this, and only KEEPBACKBUFFER is used.
#
# Default:
# KEEPBACKTIME 5

#
# After Trickling Time (seconds), some bytes are sent to browser
# to keep the connection alive. Trickling is not needed if timeouts
# are not expected for files smaller than KEEPBACKBUFFER, but it is
# recommended to set anyway.
#
# 0 = No Trickling
#
# Default:
# TRICKLING 30

#
# Configuration for F-Prot Scanner.
# Define only if F-Prot is enabled!
#
# NOTE: F-Prot daemon needs to run on same server as HAVP.
#
# Default:
# FPROTSERVER 127.0.0.1
# FPROTPORT 10200

#
# Configuration for AVG Scanner.
# Define only if AVG is enabled!
#
# NOTE: AVG daemon needs to run on the same server as HAVP.
#
# Default:
# AVGSERVER 127.0.0.1
# AVGPORT 55555

#
# Configuration for Kaspersky Scanner.
# Define only if Kaspersky is enabled!
#
# Default:
# AVESOCKET /var/run/aveserver
